# ControlMatrix

## About:

This is an application to control various outputs (like DMX, OBS, ...) from various
inputs (like Twitch Chat, StreamDeck, ...).

The features are tailored primarily on my equipment and usage, but it should be easy
to adapt them to your own needs. More features like better modularization and
extensions are planned for the future ... 

## How to run:

1. Install the requirements (in some kind of virtual environment).

        pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Add your settings to a file config.py to the folder _control_matrix_. 
   You can use the _config.example.py_ as a template.
3. Start the application

        python ./main.py
